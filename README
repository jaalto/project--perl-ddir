README: ddir - Display hierarchical directory tree
--------------------------------------------------

Display hierarchical directory tree ASCII.

The directories to include or exclude can be specified with command line
options. Ddir is a Perl implementation of the tree(1) program. The extra "d"
in front of name was used to differentiating the utility from an existing
dir(1) program.

The source package directories:

    bin/            The program and manual page (*.1)
    doc/            Documentation; generated by running "make"
