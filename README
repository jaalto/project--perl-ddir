README: ddir - Display hierarchical directory tree
--------------------------------------------------

Display an indented directory tree using ASCII graphical characters to
represent the hierarchical structure. The directories to include or exclude
can be specified with command line options. Ddir is a Perl implementation
of the tree(1) program. The extra "d" in front of name was used to
differentiating the utility from an existing dir(1) program.

The source package directories:

    bin/            The program and manual page (*.1)
    doc/            Documentation; appears after running "make"
